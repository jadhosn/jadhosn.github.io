    The scatter plot shows the percentage of each player winning across all their played games. This is the result of data aggregation that led to an analysis of each country's players bundled together.<br/>
    Disclaimer: I am personally not familiar with tennis much, hence the visualization revolved around a simple story, to describe each player's performance compared to their counterparts.<br/>
</p>
    <p>
        The visualization is fairly simple, by hovering above each bubble, the corresponding counterparts (from the same country) are highlighted, with the remaining players dimmed in the background. <br/>
        Each bubble represents a player, which is provided with a tooltip (while hovering above the bubble) showing the player's name, and their country (in the top left corner). The colors have been extended<br/>
        to cater for 49 different countries <a href="https://jnnnnn.blogspot.com/2017/02/distinct-colours-2.html">(Reference for colors)</a>

        For the detailed view to show up, the user must click on the player of interest, where a pie chart comparing the number of wins to the number of losses. The interesting conclusion is how the curve of <br/>
        success increases with more and more games played. Yet, what is interesting is that for the same percentage of win, some players played less than 5 games compared to others with 22 games. <br/>
