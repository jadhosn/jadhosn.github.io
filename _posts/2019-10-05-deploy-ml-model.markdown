In this tutorial, we are going to walk through how to deploy your machine learning 
model that you worked so hard to train and test out. After you flesh out all the 
different details, accounting for dataset imbalances, bias and confirmed with your
stakeholders that this is the real-deal, this tutorial should help you publish your 
model as an end point and make it available for scoring. 

This tutorial is definitely a very simple approach to solve this problem. 
Depending on the size of the organization, and their technology stack, the proposed
solution can change and the technology stack will also be different. BUT, keep in 
mind that they will resemble in theory. 

Put on your coding hat, and let's get started!
